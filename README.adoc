= HAL Explorer

HAL Explorer allows you to browse and explore http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[HAL]
and https://rwcbook.github.io/hal-forms/[HAL-FORMS] based RESTful Hypermedia APIs.
HAL Explorer was inspired by Mike Kelly's https://github.com/mikekelly/hal-browser[HAL-Browser]
and also supports Spring Profiles.

== Development Server

Run `yarn start` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/.
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
The development server has a built-in proxy configuration
so that all calls to `/api` are forwarded to `localhost:8080/api`
and `/docs` are forwarded to `localhost:8080/docs`.
This is convenient when you want to test a local server without having to deal with CORS.

If you run `yarn start:fs`, an additional file server is started at port 3000.
In the test-data directory, you will find some JSON examples.
Calls to `/test-data` are forwarded to `localhost:3000/test-data`.

Try it out with the URL
http://localhost:4200/#uri=/test-data/movies.hal-forms.json.

== Build

Run `yarn build` to build the project in production mode.
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

== Gradle/Java Build Support

If you have Java installed, you can also build the project with Gradle.
The Gradle build will install Node.js locally in the project directory.
Run `./gradlew build` to build the project in production mode.
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

== Integration in Your Backends

If you want to use a released version of HAL Explorer in a Java-based project,
you can define a dependency to the HAL Explorer WebJar.

Maven:
[source,xml]
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.webjars</groupId>
    <artifactId>hal-explorer</artifactId>
    <version>2.2.0</version>
</dependency>

Gradle:
[source,groovy]
runtimeOnly 'org.webjars:hal-explorer:2.2.0'

When you use the WebJar with Spring Boot, you can access HAL Explorer at `/webjars/hal-explorer/2.2.0/index.html`.
The easiest way to integrate the upstream version of HAL Explorer into your backend is to clone this Git repository,
do a production build, and then copy the content of the `dist/` folder to a location accessible by your backend.
When you use Spring Boot, a good location in your project's source tree would be
`src/main/resources/static/hal-explorer`.

== Running Tests

* `yarn test` runs the unit test suite against your default browser.
* `yarn test:headless` runs the unit test suite against headless Chrome.
* `yarn e2e` runs the e2e test suite against default browsers (using Playwright).

Take a look at `package.json` for more test options.

== Development

=== Git Hooks

This project uses https://typicode.github.io/husky/[Husky] to manage Git hooks:

* **Pre-commit hook**: Automatically formats staged files using Prettier via lint-staged
* **Commit-msg hook**: Validates commit messages against conventional commit standards

=== Commit Message Convention

Commit messages must follow the https://www.conventionalcommits.org/[Conventional Commits] specification.
The format is: `type(scope): subject`

Valid types are: `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `revert`, `style`, `test`

Examples:
[source]
----
feat: add dark mode support
fix: resolve navigation bug in sidebar
docs: update installation instructions
----

The commit message will be automatically validated when you commit.

=== Code Formatting

This project uses https://prettier.io/[Prettier] for code formatting.
Files are automatically formatted on commit, but you can also run formatting manually:

* `yarn format` - Format all source files
* `yarn format:check` - Check if files are formatted correctly

= HAL Explorer

With HAL Explorer you can browse and explore http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[HAL]
and https://rwcbook.github.io/hal-forms/[HAL-FORMS] based RESTful Hypermedia APIs.
HAL Explorer was inspired by Mike Kelly's https://github.com/mikekelly/hal-browser[HAL-Browser].
HAL Explorer also supports Spring Profiles.

== Development Server

Run `yarn start` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/.
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
The development server has a build-in proxy configuration
so that all calls to `/api` are forwarded to `localhost:8080/api`.
This is convenient when you want to test a local server without having to deal with CORS.
If you run `yarn startl`, an additional file server is started with port 3000.
In the test-data directory, you find some JSON examples. Try it out with the URL
http://localhost:4200/#uri=http://localhost:3000/movies.hal-forms.json.

== Build

Run `yarn build` to build the project in production mode.
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

== Gradle/Java Build Support

If you have Java installed, you can also build the project with Gradle.
The Gradle build will install Node.js locally in the project directory.
Run `./gradlew build` to build the project in production mode.
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

== Integration in your Backends

If you want to use a released version of HAL Explorer in a Java-based project,
you could define a dependency to the HAL Explorer WebJar.

Maven:
[source,xml]
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.webjars</groupId>
    <artifactId>hal-explorer</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.3</version>
</dependency>

Gradle:
[source, Groovy]
implementation 'org.webjars:hal-explorer:1.2.3'

When you use the WebJar with Spring Boot, you can access the HAL Explorer at `/webjars/hal-explorer/1.2.3/index.html`.
The easiest way to integrate the upstream version of HAL Explorer into your backend would be to clone this Git repo,
do a production build and then copy the content of the dist folder to a location accessible by your backend server.
When you use Spring Boot, a good location in your project's source tree would be
src/main/java/resources/static/hal-explorer.

== Running Tests

* `yarn test` to run the unit test suite against your default browser.
* `yarn test-headless` to run the unit test suite against headless Chrome.
* `yarn e2e` to run the e2e test suite against your default browser.
* `yarn e2e-headless` to run the e2e test suite against headless Chrome.

Take a look at `package.json` for more test options.

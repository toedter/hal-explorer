[[color-mode]]
== Color Mode

HAL Explorer supports three color modes:

* *Light* - Light color scheme
* *Dark* - Dark color scheme
* *Auto* - Automatically detects your system's preferred color scheme (default)

The color mode is stored in your browser's local storage and persists across sessions.

The selected theme is stored in your browser's local storage with the `hal-explorer.theme` key and persists across sessions. Themes automatically adapt to your selected color mode (light/dark/auto) for an optimal viewing experience.

[[settings]]
== Settings

The _Settings_ menu helps you to customize HAL Explorer's behavior and user interface. All settings are automatically saved to your browser's local storage with the `hal-explorer.` prefix and persist across sessions.

=== Layout

Choose between different column layouts to optimize your workspace (see <<Curie-based Documentation>> for more details):

* *2 Column Layout* - Default layout with two columns
** Documentation panel appears only when explicitly toggled
** Provides more horizontal space for the main content
** Ideal for smaller screens or when documentation is not frequently needed

* *3 Column Layout* - Expanded layout with three columns
** Documentation is always visible when available
** Provides a comprehensive overview of resources, actions, and documentation simultaneously
** Best for larger screens and documentation-heavy APIs

=== Use HTTP OPTIONS

When enabled, HAL Explorer automatically sends HTTP OPTIONS requests to discover which HTTP methods are supported for a given link URI.

This feature helps you understand the available operations without having to consult external API documentation. The supported methods are then displayed as available actions for that resource.

*Default:* Disabled

=== Enable all HTTP Methods for HAL-FORMS Links

When enabled, all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, etc.) are available for links in HAL-FORMS documents, even if no explicit template is defined for that method.

Typically, HAL-FORMS `_templates` explicitly specify affordances with their corresponding HTTP methods. However, this setting is useful when:

* You need to test different HTTP methods on the same endpoint
* Your API supports additional methods not documented in the HAL-FORMS template
* You want to explore API capabilities beyond the standard template definitions

*Default:* Disabled

*Note:* Use this setting with caution, as it may allow operations that the API doesn't actually support.

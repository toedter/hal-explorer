== Releases and Demos

Here you find the documentation for the latest release and the current snapshot,
as well as the latest release and the current snapshot of HAL Explorer (both with examples):

[cols='1,1,2',stripes=even]

| Latest Release | 1.2.3 | https://toedter.github.io/hal-explorer/release/hal-explorer/#theme=Cosmo&uri=examples/examples.hal-forms.json[HAL Explorer Demo]
| Current Snapshot | 1.2.4-SNAPSHOT | https://toedter.github.io/hal-explorer/snapshot/hal-explorer/#theme=Cosmo&uri=examples/examples.hal-forms.json[HAL Explorer Demo]

To explore your services with these HAL Explorer demos, they have to enable CORS.
When you want to explore a Spring-based service (e.g. running on localhost), you could (temporarily) add a simple
https://gist.github.com/toedter/72d62b4bb4a25d229dc1f1342ae429ad[CORS Filter] to your service. For more options, see
section <<Development Server>>.

You can also play with the latest snapshot version of HAL Explorer.

== Integration with your Backends

If you want to use a released version of HAL Explorer in a Java-based project,
you could define a dependency to the HAL Explorer WebJar.

[source,xml,indent=0,role="primary"]
.Maven
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.webjars</groupId>
    <artifactId>hal-explorer</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.3</version>
</dependency>
----

[source,groovy,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
implementation 'org.webjars:hal-explorer:1.2.3'
----

When you use the WebJar with Spring Boot, you can access the HAL Explorer
in a Web browser at `/webjars/hal-explorer/1.2.3/index.html`.

If you are using Spring Data REST, you could instead add a dependency like

[source,xml,indent=0,role="primary"]
.Maven
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-data-rest-hal-explorer</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

[source,groovy,indent=0,role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
implementation 'org.springframework.data:spring-data-rest-hal-explorer'
----

When you use `spring-data-rest-hal-explorer`, you can access the HAL Explorer in a Web browser at `/`.

Of course, you could always download a zip-based https://github.com/toedter/hal-explorer/releases/download/v1.2.3/hal-explorer-1.2.3.zip[distribution] and put it on any Web server.

The easiest way to integrate the upstream version of HAL Explorer into your backend would be to clone this Git repo,
do a production build (see below) and then copy the content of the dist folder to a location accessible by your backend server.
When you use Spring Boot, a good location in your project's source tree would be
src/main/java/resources/static/hal-explorer.

== Build

=== node.js

** Install the latest version of https://nodejs.og[node.js] and yarn (`npm i -g yarn`).
** Run `yarn build` to build the project in production mode.
** The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

=== Development Server

Run `yarn start` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/.
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
The development server has a build-in proxy configuration
so that all calls to `/api` are forwarded to `localhost:8080/api`.
This is convenient when you want to test a local server without having to deal with CORS.
If you run `yarn startl`, an additional file server is started with port 3000.
In the test-data directory, you find some JSON examples. Try it out with the URL
http://localhost:4200/#uri=http://localhost:3000/movies.hal-forms.json.

=== Gradle/Java Build Support

If you have Java installed, you can also build the project with Gradle.
The Gradle build will install Node.js locally in the project directory.
Run `./gradlew build` (or just `gradlew build` under Windows) to build the project in production mode.
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

=== Building the docs

You can build this documentation

* Windows: `gradlew doc`
** If you see errors regarding file encoding, try `gradlew doc -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8`
* Linux: `./gradlew doc`

=== Running Tests

* `yarn test` to run the unit test suite against your default browser.
* `yarn test-headless` to run the unit test suite against headless Chrome.
* `yarn e2e` to run the e2e test suite against your default browser.
* `yarn e2e-headless` to run the e2e test suite against headless Chrome.

Take a look at `package.json` for more test options.

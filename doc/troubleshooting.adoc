This chapter helps you resolve common issues when using HAL Explorer.

== Connection Issues

=== CORS Errors

*Problem:* Browser console shows CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors when trying to access your API.

*Error Message:*
----
Access to fetch at 'http://api.example.com/' from origin 'https://hal-explorer.com'
has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present
on the requested resource.
----

*Solutions:*

1. *Enable CORS on Your Server* (Recommended for development):
+
Add CORS headers to your API responses. See the <<setup.adoc#_using_online_demos_with_your_api,CORS Setup>> section for Spring Boot examples.

2. *Use the Development Server*:
+
Clone HAL Explorer and run it locally with `yarn start`. The development server includes proxy configuration that avoids CORS issues. See <<setup.adoc#dev-server,Development Server>>.

3. *Integrate HAL Explorer into Your Backend*:
+
Deploy HAL Explorer as part of your application. See <<setup.adoc#_backend_integration,Backend Integration>> options.

4. *Browser Extension* (Development only):
+
Install a browser extension like "CORS Unblock" or "Allow CORS".
+
WARNING: Only use CORS browser extensions for development. They disable important security features.

== Getting Help

If you can't resolve your issue:

1. *Check Browser Console*:
+
Open DevTools (F12) and look for errors in the Console and Network tabs.

2. *Test with curl*:
+
Verify your API works outside HAL Explorer:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -H "Accept: application/hal+json" http://your-api.com/endpoint
----

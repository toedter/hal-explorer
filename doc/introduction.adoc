== What is HAL Explorer?

HAL Explorer is a web-based tool for browsing and exploring RESTful Hypermedia APIs that use the HAL (Hypertext Application Language) and HAL-FORMS specifications. It provides an intuitive interface for developers and API consumers to navigate hypermedia-driven APIs, discover available resources, and interact with them using various HTTP methods.

[[why-hal-explorer]]
== Why Use HAL Explorer?

Traditional API exploration tools focus on endpoint documentation and testing. HAL Explorer takes a different approach by embracing the hypermedia-driven nature of REST APIs:

* *Self-Discovery*: Navigate APIs by following links, just as intended by REST and HATEOAS principles
* *Visual Exploration*: See the structure of your API responses with syntax highlighting and collapsible sections
* *Built-in Documentation*: View inline documentation through CURIE links without leaving the interface
* *Developer-Friendly*: Test POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE operations with guided form inputs
* *Framework Support*: First-class support for Spring Data REST profiles and HAL-FORMS affordances

[[fundamentals]]
== Fundamentals

HAL Explorer was inspired by Mike Kelly's https://github.com/mikekelly/hal-browser[HAL-Browser] and extends it with modern features including dark mode, multiple themes, HAL-FORMS support, and Spring Data REST integration.

=== Prerequisites

To get the most out of HAL Explorer and this documentation, you should be familiar with:

* *REST API Concepts*: Basic understanding of HTTP methods, status codes, and RESTful design
* *HAL Specification*: The http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[HAL] standard for representing resources with links and embedded resources
* *HAL-FORMS Specification*: The https://rwcbook.github.io/hal-forms/[HAL-FORMS] extension for describing affordances and form templates
* *JSON Format*: Basic knowledge of JSON syntax and structure

=== Supported Media Types

HAL Explorer can consume and display the following media types:

* `application/hal+json` - Standard HAL format
* `application/prs.hal-forms+json` - HAL-FORMS format with affordances
* `application/json` - Plain JSON (limited functionality)


[[features]]
== Features Overview

HAL Explorer provides a comprehensive set of features for exploring and interacting with HAL and HAL-FORMS APIs.

=== User Interface

==== Theming and Appearance

* *Color Modes*
** *Dark Mode* - Optimized for low-light environments
** *Light Mode* - Traditional bright interface
** *Auto Mode* - Automatically detects and adapts to system preference (default)

** Cosmo theme is the default (clean, modern flat design)
** All themes adapt to your selected color mode

==== Layout Options

* *2 Column Layout* (Default)
** Resource explorer on the left
** Response details on the right
** Documentation panel toggles on demand
** Ideal for smaller screens or focused work

* *3 Column Layout*
** Resource explorer on the left
** Response details in the middle
** Documentation always visible on the right
** Best for larger screens and documentation-heavy APIs

=== API Interaction

==== HTTP Method Support

* *Full REST Method Support*
** GET - Retrieve resources
** POST - Create new resources
** PUT - Replace existing resources
** PATCH - Partially update resources
** DELETE - Remove resources
** OPTIONS - Discover available operations (optional, configurable)

* *URI Handling*
** Simple URIs - Direct resource access
** Templated URIs - Interactive parameter editor with validation
** Automatic template parameter detection

==== Request Customization

* *Custom Headers*
** Add authorization tokens (Bearer, Basic Auth, etc.)
** Set custom Accept headers for HAL or HAL-FORMS
** Configure any HTTP header needed by your API
** Headers stored in URL fragment for sharing

* *Request Editor*
** Form-based input for HAL-FORMS and Spring profiles
** Real-time validation with error messages
** Query parameter support for templated URIs

* *Keyboard Shortcuts*
** `Enter` - Submit requests
** `ESC` - Close dialogs
** Streamlined workflow for rapid exploration

=== Advanced Features

==== Spring Data REST Integration

HAL Explorer provides first-class support for Spring Data REST APIs:

* Automatic detection of Spring Data REST profiles
* JSON Schema-based property discovery
* Auto-populated form fields based on entity definitions
* Content-type negotiation and detection

==== HAL-FORMS Support

Full implementation of the HAL-FORMS specification:

* Template elements displayed inline with links
* Property definitions with type information
* Options support (inline values and external links)
* Multiple selection for array properties
* Comprehensive validation (required fields, regex patterns, min/max values)
* Prompt text and placeholder support

==== Documentation Integration

* *CURIE-based Documentation*
** Click book icons to view inline documentation
** Documentation appears in dedicated panel
** No need to leave the interface or consult external docs

* *Scrollable Documentation Mode*
** Keep documentation visible without excessive page scrolling
** Fixed-height iframe for large documentation sets
** Configurable through settings

==== Error Handling

* Graceful handling of HTTP error responses (4xx, 5xx)
* HAL-FORMS documents displayed even in error scenarios
* Links and affordances remain accessible for recovery
* Clear display of error status codes and messages

=== Data Management

==== Browser Storage

All settings and preferences persist across sessions:

* Color mode preference
* Selected theme
* Column layout choice
* HTTP OPTIONS setting
* HAL-FORMS method enablement
* Documentation scrolling mode

Storage uses the `hal-explorer.` namespace to avoid conflicts.

==== Bookmarking and Sharing

Configuration embedded in URLs for easy sharing:

* Current API URI
* Custom request headers
* Share exact API state with colleagues
* Bookmark frequently accessed endpoints

=== Response Exploration

* *Syntax-Highlighted Display*
** Color-coded JSON for easy reading
** Expandable/collapsible sections
** Navigate complex nested structures

* *Organized Sections*
** Properties - Top-level resource attributes
** Links - Available hypermedia links with affordances
** Embedded Resources - Nested resources with full link support
** Templates - HAL-FORMS affordances (when available)

* *Response Metadata*
** HTTP status code and status text
** All response headers
** Full response body
** Response timing information

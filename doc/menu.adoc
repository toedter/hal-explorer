[[color-mode]]
== Color Mode

HAL Explorer supports three color modes:

* *Light* - Light color scheme
* *Dark* - Dark color scheme
* *Auto* - Automatically detects your system's preferred color scheme (default)

The color mode is stored in your browser's local storage and persists across sessions.

[[theming]]
== Theming

HAL Explorer supports all the https://bootswatch.com/[Bootswatch] themes (by Thomas Park).
The default theme is Cosmo. You can select from 25+ different themes, including:

* Default (HAL Explorer's default theme)
* Cosmo, Darkly, Flatly, Materia, and many more

The selected theme is stored in your browser's local storage and persists across sessions.

[[settings]]
== Settings

In the _Settings_ submenu, you can configure:

* *Layout* - Choose between different column layouts (see <<Curie-based Documentation>>)
** _2 Column Layout_ - Two columns with optional documentation
** _3 Column Layout_ - Three columns with documentation always visible when available

* *Use HTTP OPTIONS* - Enable automatic HTTP OPTIONS requests to discover which HTTP methods are supported for a given link URI

* *Enable all HTTP Methods for HAL-FORMS Links* - Enable all HTTP methods for links in HAL-FORMS documents
** Usually, HAL-FORMS `_templates` are used to specify affordances with explicit HTTP methods. However, there are some use cases where you might want to make calls using HTTP methods other than GET for certain links.

* *Scrollable Documentation* - When enabled, documentation is rendered in a scrollable iframe with a fixed maximum height instead of expanding the main page height

All settings are stored in your browser's local storage with the `hal-explorer.` prefix and persist across sessions.
